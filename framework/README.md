# Samewave Framework Front-end Developer Assessment
This test aims to assess your front-end development proficiency and expertise level with regards to using a modern framework to plan, build and integrate a UI component.

## Instructions
You are required to develop the component as per the requirements below.

### Component Requirements
The component you are required to build is a simple prompt component that conforms to the following requirements:
- The prompt must be displayed on a transparent overlay that fills the whole screen
- Some prompts are persistent and requires the user to click a confirmation button to dismiss it. Other prompts will dissappear after a short period of time. 
- A prompt could contain a graphic.
- A prompt could contain an icon. The colour of the icon will be determined by the type of prompt shown: error, success, confirmation, info
- A sticky prompt should only be dismissed if the user clicks on the confirmation button.
- A disappearing prompt should also be dismissed if the user clicks on the overlay.

You will find out mobile UI design specs at this URL: https://xd.adobe.com/spec/823b1bb3-4029-4d15-6434-149ac660adfe-f40a/#screen/fee5a626-1b7d-4c2d-90e3-1b70daa54fc7/Tip%20-%20Stream%20Editors

All the relevant design information (dimensions, colour, typography etc) is available in the interactive design spec.

The relevant screens are from number 118 to 123. Use the arrows at the bottom of the page to navigate between them.

#### Assets
The graphics and icons in the design specs have been added to the _resources directory in this repo.

### Code Requirements
#### HTML
You should write HTML that conforms to the HTML5 specification and is semantically correct.

#### CSS
You should write CSS that conforms to the CSS3 specification.  
You should ideally be using SASS.  
You should preferably be using the BEM methodology for naming your classes.

#### JavaScript Framework
You can use any Javascript framework that you are comfortable with like Ember, React, Angular, Vue etc.

#### Device Support
Your component will be displayed on mobile and desktop devices and as such you should plan for it to have a fluid width.

#### Browser Support
You do not have to (_but you may_) code with cross-browser support in mind.  
The only browser you need to support is Chrome (latest stable version).

### Code submission
You are required to create a repo on your own github account, make all your commits there, and then when done send us the link to the repo.  
Please ensure your commit messages are succinct as we will be looking at it as part of the assessment.

## Assessment criteria
We will be looking at the following aspects when assessing you:
- Your planning towards building the component
- Your ability to communicate your thought patterns
- Your mastery of your development tools
- Visual accuracy in matching the design requirements of the component
- Whether you used semantic well formed HTML
- Syntactically correct CSS and correct BEM class naming
- Readability of your code
